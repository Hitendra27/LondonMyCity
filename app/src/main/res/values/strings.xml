        <string name="trams_detail">
        London\'s tram network, currently known as Tramlink, primarily serves the South London area, particularly around Croydon.  Trams are a smooth, comfortable, and often less crowded alternative to buses, offering a different way to get around in this part of the city. The trams run on dedicated tracks, so they are not affected by road traffic. \n\n
        Tramlink connects to the National Rail network at several stations, making it easy to transfer to other parts of London and beyond. The same Oyster cards and contactless payments used on the Tube and buses are valid on the trams. You only need to tap in when you board the tram, not when you exit. Trams are known for being particularly punctual and for having a smooth ride.\n\n
        The tram network is quite limited compared to the Tube or bus network, focusing primarily on South London. However, it\'s a very useful option if you\'re travelling within the areas it serves. The trams are quite modern and have large windows, so you get a great view of the area. \n\n
        Don\'t forget to check the tram route map if you\'re travelling in South London. Remember to look at the tram destination to ensure you\'re getting on the correct service. Don\'t forget to ask!

        <string name="national_rail">National Rail Services</string>
        <string name="national_rail_detail">
        National Rail services are the main intercity train lines that connect London to the rest of the UK.  London has numerous major train stations, each serving different parts of the country.  These stations include King\'s Cross, Paddington, Euston, Victoria, and Waterloo, among others. These stations are usually connected to the Tube and buses.\n\n
        National Rail services are an essential way to reach places outside of London, whether you\'re heading to a coastal town, a historic city, or the countryside.  Trains are generally much faster than buses for long-distance journeys, but ticket prices vary widely depending on the route and the time of travel. It\'s important to plan your journey ahead.\n\n
        You can often get discounted fares if you book your tickets in advance, especially for long-distance travel.  Make sure to check the departure platform and any potential delays before you travel. Train stations can be very busy, especially during rush hour, so give yourself plenty of time to navigate through them. There are usually many shops and restaurants in the train stations.\n\n
        Don\'t forget to check your train schedule and departure platform carefully. Remember to be aware of your belongings at all times, especially in busy stations. Don\'t forget to ask!

<!--    Unlike the Tube zone fare system, a single London bus journey costs £1.75 no matter how far you go.

No matter how many buses or trams you take in a day, it will never cost you more than £5.25 total – just make sure you use the same payment card for every journey.\n-->
<!--    For contactless payment cards issued outside the UK, check with your bank to find out whether transaction fees or other charges apply.\n-->
<!--    Paying your London bus fare is easy. Simply touch your Oyster card or contactless payment card on the yellow card reader as you board the bus or show the driver your paper Travelcard. To avoid card clash, make sure to only touch one card on the yellow reader and keep your other cards separate.\n-->
<!--    If you don’t have enough credit on your Visitor Oyster card or Oyster card, you will be able to make one more journey on a bus before needing to top up.\n-->
